Decontractors: A Programming by Contract implementation using Decorators
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The implementation idea came to me while discussion Design by Contract
implementations (pyContract, pyDBC, ...) at the May 2011 meeting
of PyUGAT, the Python User Group Austria. Initial release: 2011-05-19

Python 3 support: This library has been tested with Python 3.2.2. You might
need to run the 2to3 utility to convert the sources, like this:

   2to3 -w decontractors.py examples/*.py

If you want to use the decontractors only for development, but then avoid all
checks during development, you can use the "nodecontractors" module instead of
the "decontractors" module. This provides the same classes, but does nothing.

Thanks to the following people who provided valuable feedback:
